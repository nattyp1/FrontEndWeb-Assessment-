<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Natalie</h1>

<p> content creator, model, and digital nomad.</p>
<p>  Natalie Perkins is a graduate of Howard University
     majoring in advertising with a minor concentration in political science. 
     Throughout her college years, Natalie has been developing her creative skills.
     For the fall 2019 semester, Natalie studied abroad at the University of Westminister in London, UK. 
     She spent the semester learning about arts and culture and exploring European countries
     such as exploring the baths in Budapest, prancing around Barcelona like the Cheetah Girls 
     and happily riding the bus 1 hr plus each way to lectures. 
     
        Natalie also has a passion for 
     fashion and she has modeled for notable fashion designers and skin care lines in the United States
     and the United Kingdom.She also has a niche for photography and her photo was featured on the
     November 2019 Topsify Playlist cover. Living in Europe made Natalie think of Advertising outside
     of just selling products and for healing the world. She hopes to use advertising to educate 
     people on sustainability and build up communities. Natalie is recognized for her friendly 
    demeanor and her positive energy can brighten up a room. </p>
